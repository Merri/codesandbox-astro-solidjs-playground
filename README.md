# Astro + SolidJS on CodeSandbox

This is a working Vite setup for Astro and SolidJS.

Also has Prettier and TypeScript. Uses Yarn because CodeSandbox does that and you probably can't change it.

Feel free to <strike>steal</strike> copy the root files and change to what you like to use.

## Development

For local development use `yarn dev` (CodeSandbox uses `yarn start`). This way Vite works for you in localhost.
